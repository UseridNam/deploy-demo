    <h1>Welcome! This is a main heading.</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph. A paragraph contains
    text as one may assume based on its name.</p>

    <p>There can be multiple paragraphs that are
    placed next to each other. When viewing the
    document with a browser, each paragraph is
    followed with whitespace -- that is, the
    paragraphs on a page are not glued together.</p>

    <p>What the paragraphs actually look like in
    a browser can be adjusted. We will look into
    styling web pages later on.</p>

    <h2>Subheading</h2>

    <p>Text is written under subheading in the
    same way as under main headings (and other
    headings).</p>
